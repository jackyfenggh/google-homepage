This is the first project in the Odin Project foundations course.

The task was to rebuild the Google Homepage.

Some properties that were used that I'd like to mention are as follows:

1. grid-template-columns
2. grid-template-rows
3. align-self
4. justify-self

A few things I will revisit:

1. Inline vs block + implications for positioning and what properties can/can't be used.
2. The different values for position.
3. text-align vs align-self vs justify-self.
